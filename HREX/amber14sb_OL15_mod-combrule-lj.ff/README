# From the group that created these files for GROMACS :
# https://fch.upol.cz/ff_ol/gromacs.php
#
# amber14sb_OL15.ff package includes :
#
# 1- ff14SB [14] force field for proteins, originally implemented for GROMACS by Man Hoang Viet 
#    (amber14sb.ff.tar.gz from GROMACS force field repository)
# 2- ff99bsc0Ï‡OL3 [4] parameters for RNA, originally implemented for GROMACS by Man Hoang Viet 
#    (amber14sb.ff.tar.gz from GROMACS force field repository)
# 3- OL15 [8] parameters for DNA
# 4- Joung-Cheatham parameters for monovalent ions in TIP3P (as in frcmod.ionsjc_tip3p in AMBER package)
# 5- Allner et al. [15] parameters for Mg2+ ions
#
# Validation
# Vacuum single point energies were calculated on snapshots from MD trajectories (water and ions excluded) 
# for three different systems, DNA (24 residues, 100 snapshots), RNA (4 residues, 100 snapshots), and protein-DNA 
# complex (258 residues, 20 snapshots). Individual potential energy components have been compared between 
# GROMACS 4.5.1 (amber14sb_OL15.ff) and AMBER 16 (leaprc.protein.ff14SB, learpc.RNA.OL3, leaprc.DNA.OL15). 
# Mean relative errors are shown below (see the website).

# Sebastien Cote : I did some modifications to the amber14sb_OL15 force field.
#
# 1- Added these three lines in ffbonded.itp for improper torsion angles :
#
# NA  CV  CC  CT       4      180.00     4.60240     2    ; SC : added from amber99sb-ildn since HID needs it.
# NB  CW  CC  CT       4      180.00     4.60240     2    ; SC : added from amber99sb-ildn since HIE needs it.
# NA  CW  CC  CT       4      180.00     4.60240     2    ; SC : added from amber99sb-ildn since HIP needs it.
#
# 2- Put back the ions parameters of amber99sb in ffnonbonded.itp. I instead created seperate files that are
#    compatible with Joung JPCB 2008 for TIP3P and SCP/E. I did this because it might be confusing when doing
#    simulation with proteins. Also, the parameters of Joung that were in ffnonbonded were only compatible 
#    with TIP3P. This might be confusing and cause error if the water model is note chosen accordingly.
